# Basic client-server
A simple server-client implementation written in C for studying purposes. All this server does is send the string “Hello, world!” out over a stream connection. 
All you need to do to test this server is run it in one window, and telnet to it from another with:
   
         $ telnet localhost 3490
   
 or run a client with :
   
         $ ./client localhost
